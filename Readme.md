# My mantra: 1st code. 2nd blog.

In this repo I keep a record of small experiments toyed around with for [my blog posts](https://roberttlange.github.io/year-archive/). Bigger pieces of code can be found in separate repositories. Write me a PM if there is something fishy.

## Keeping track of things
